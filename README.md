# python-elevationapi â€” Get the elevation of (almost) any point on Earth
elevationapi is a simple library that interfaces with 
http://www.elevationapi.xyz . It permits you to get the elevation of almost any 
point on Earth.


## Example
````python
from elevationapi import Elevation
e = Elevation()

elevation_of_Geneva = e.getElevation(46.2, 6.15)

#When asking for multiple points, use this instead:
elevations = e.getElevations((46.2, 6.15), (6.3, 6.20))
````

## Using another API provider
Simply instance Elevation with:
````python
e = Elevation(base_url='http://your-server.tld/api')
````
